The purpose of this project is to apply simple linear regression using Python to a powerproduction dataset and to explain what is happening at each stage in the process. The goal is to accurately predict wind turbine power output from wind speed values using the data set as a basis.
The submission is in the form of a git repository containing the following items:
1. Jupyter notebook that performs simple linear regression on the data set.
2. In that notebook, an explanation of the applied regression and an analysis of its accuracy.
3. Standard items in a git repository such as a README.

## Notebook summary:
The notebook is divided into 5 parts:
- Part 1) Initial analysis of powerproduction dataset. View data using Seaborn Scatterplot and perform linear analsysis on untrained data to see margin of error.
- Part 2) Perform linear analsysis on trained data to see if margin of error is reduced and if straight line plot is suitable for the given dataset.
- Part 3) Remove the outlier 0.000 values from the dataset to see if this reduces the margin of error.
- Part 4) Apply polynomial regression to the dataset as the relationship between wind speed and power output at lower and higher wind speeds means a straight line plot is not appropriate for the given dataset.
- Part 5) Compare straight line plot versus polynomial predicttions for power output at 10km/hr wind speed.
- Part 6) Following on from material provided in class lectures. Additional analysis on the dataset includes finding the best fit striaght line plot and determining its stuitability for the dataset.
